<A name=AT alt=""><b><font color="#00004E">3 Species Chronic Screen</b></font></A> -- Many NPDES permits   call for an initial 3 species screen consisting of a vertebrate, invertebrate and a plant. The most sensitive species is then selected for the remaining testing. This 3 species screen may be repeated for  the first two or three test periods or yearly, depending on permit specifications.<p>
<A name=AT alt=""><b><font color="#00004E">Acute 
toxicity</b></font></A> -- The discernible adverse effects induced in an organism 
within a short period of time (days) of exposure to a chemical. For aquatic 
animals, this usually refers to continuous exposure to the chemical in water for 
a period of up to four days. The effects (lethal or sub-lethal) occurring may 
usually be observed within the period of exposure with aquatic organisms. Acute 
toxicity is usually defined as TUa = 100/LC50. Note that acute means short, not 
mortality.<p><b><font color="#00004E"><A name=ATT alt="">Acute Toxicity test</b></font></A> -- A method 
used to determine the concentration of a substance that produces a toxic effect 
on a specified percentage of test organisms in a short period of time (e.g., 96 
hours). As a general guideline, death is the measure of toxicity.<p><b><font color="#00004E"><A 
name=AMB alt="">Ambient Toxicity</b></font></A> -- Toxicity found in the "unaffected" 
portion of an effluent's receiving waters.<p><b><font color="#00004E"><A name=B 
alt="">Bioassay</A></b></font> -- A test used to evaluate the relative potency of a 
chemical by comparing its effect on a living organism with the effect of a 
standard preparation on the same type of organism. The term "bioassay" is 
commonly, though not technically correct, used interchangeably with the term 
"toxicity test".<p><b><font color="#00004E"><A name=CT alt="">Chronic toxicity</A></b></font> -- An 
adverse effect that lingers or continues for a relatively long period of time. A 
chronic effect can be lethality, growth, reduced reproduction, etc. Chronic 
toxicity is defined as TUc = 100/NOEC or TUc = 100/ECp (or 100/ICp). Note: 
chronic means long.<p><A name=CTT alt=""><b><font color="#00004E">Chronic toxicity test</A></b></font> 
-- A method used to determine the concentration of a substance in water that 
produces an adverse effect on a test organism over an extended period of time. 
Reductions in reproduction or growth are measures of chronic effects.<p><A 
name=CV alt=""><b><font color="#00004E">Coefficient of Variation (CV)</A></b></font> -- The standard 
statistical measurement of the relative variation of a distritubtion or set of 
data, defined as the standard deviation divided by the mean. Coefficient of 
variation is a measurement of precision within and and among laboratories. 
<p><A name=CI alt=""><b><font color="#00004E">Confidence limits or interval (CI)</A></b></font> -- The 
limits or interval within which, at some specified level of probability, the

life span in which it is the most susceptible to adverse effects caused by 
exposure to toxicants, usually during early development (egg, embryo, larvae). 
Chronic toxicity tests are often run on critical life stages to replace long 
duration, life cycle tests since the toxic effect occurs during the critical 
life stage.<p><A name=D alt=""><b><font color="#00004E">Death</b></font></A> -- Defined as the lack of 
movement or reaction even after gentle prodding,<p><A name=DB 
alt=""><b><font color="#00004E">Definitive bioassay</b></font></A> -- A bioassay designed to establish

multiple replicates.<p><A name=DA alt=""><b><font color="#00004E">Dilution allowance</b></font></A> --

exposed to a test solution.<p><A name=FT alt=""><b><font color="#00004E">Flow-through 
tests</b></font></A> -- Refers to the continuous or very frequent passage of fresh test 
solution through a test chamber with no recycling. Because of the large volume 
(often 400 L/day) of effluent normally required for flow-through tests, it is 
generally considered too costly and impractical to conduct these tests off-site 
at a central laboratory.<p><A name=HWT alt=""><b><font color="#00004E">Hazardous Waste

occrred. These interpulative methods do not require that the desired endpoint 
concentration concntration be actually tetsed as in hypothesis 
testing.<p><A name=PS alt=""><b><font color="#00004E">Point source</A></b></font> -- A discrete 
conveyance such as a pipe, ditch, etc. contributing pollutants to the

primary and secondary (biological) treatment.<p><A name=RTOX 
alt=""><b><font color="#00004E">Reference Toxicant</A></b></font> -- A chemical used to access the constancy
