<b><u>NPDES - ACUTE Bioassay</b></u><BR>

<img src="images/graphic_acu.gif" border="0" align="right"><p>This toxicity test is conducted on municipal wastewaters that are
directly discharged into receiving waters (streams, rivers, ocean,
etc.) or on industrial
dischargers who may or may not have their own outfall. There are
several editions of the EPA's <a href="term.html#AT">acute testing</a>
manual, each having minor differences which
may significantly influence the outcome of the test. The most recent
edition, the fifth (EPA-821-R-02-012) calls for using fish of one to 14
days in age and a
minimum renewal at 48 hours. Both of these requirements tend to make
this test more sensitive than previous editions of the test method. A
detailed test
protocol of this method is given below. Also the entire acute manual is
available directly from EPA's homepage. You may access it by clicking <a href="http://www.epa.gov/OST/WET/disk2/"><strong>here</strong></a>.
Our
laboratory is also certified to conduct toxicity tests following the
older fourth edition protocol (EPA/600/4-90/027F). This manual may be
still referenced in
NPDES permits and differs little from the new manual. The choice of
which protocol is often directed by regional water quality control
boards and should be
specified in the <a href="term.html#NPDES">NPDES</a> permit.  Any protocol modifications are also usually listed in the NPDES permit.  </p>

<p>The basic acute test uses a series of five test chambers each
containing a specific concentration of the effluent diluted with
standard laboratory water plus a
control. A common dilution series such as: 100%, 50%, 25%, 12.5%, and
6.25% may be used. The dilution series may be specified in the NPDES
permit and
may differ between permits to reflect individual regulatory concerns.
Ten test fish are placed into each chamber and their survival and water
quality of the test
chambers are monitored for 96 hours. All tests are conducted in <a href="cgi-bin/term.html#REP">replicate</a>
(2, 4, or 5 replicates, depending upon species). The number of fish
surviving at
each test concentration and in the control chamber at the end of the
test are used to mathematically calculate the sample concentration
toxic to 50% of the test
fish. This known as the LC50. Toxicity units can then be calculated by
dividing 100 by the LC50 value. For example, an LC50 of 75% would yield
a TU of
1.3 TUa (100/75 Toxic Units acute). This test protocol can also be
conducted as a percent survival bioassay where 100% sample is divided
into two or more
test tanks, fish are added, and water quality and survival are
monitored for 96 hours. Results are then reported as percent survival
in 100% effluent.<br>
<br>
Other important considerations: </p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Test organism</strong> - there are over 45 different
species listed in the EPA manual, ranging from water fleas to rainbow
trout, however fathead minnows are by
far the most commonly used organism; </li>
  <li><strong>Length of test</strong> - tests can range from 24 to 96 hours in length with 48 and 96 hour tests the most common; </li>
  <li><strong>Static or static renewal </strong>- in <a href="term.html#ST">static tests</a> solutions are mixed at the beginning of the test with test organisms exposed to the same solution throughout the
test, while in <a href="term.html#SRT">static renewal tests</a> solutions are mixed and changed daily or at a minimum every 48 hours (these are much more labor intensive and therefore
more expensive).<br>
</li>
<br>
</ol>

<p><strong>SPECIAL CONDITIONS: </strong>Sample hold time is 36 hours.
Sample volumes are: one gallon for static and two and a half gallons
for some static-renewal tests. Samples should be kept cold (4<sup>o</sup>C) prior to and during
shipment to the laboratory. Sample containers, coolers and blue ice
available upon request. We
recommend shipping via Federal Express Priority Overnight Service.
